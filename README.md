# Chemuru Lasya-Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Lasya! I have an analytical background in Mechanics and am currently completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification on Coursera while awaiting onboarding at TCS. My passion lies in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, where I enjoy transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive business decisions.

I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data analytics, and visualization tools.Iâ€™ve sharpened my skills through case study competitions, earning runner-up in Data Doyen (IMT Ghaziabad). My portfolio includes projects integrating analytics and ML, keeping pace with evolving technologies. My experience in pattern recognition, trend analysis, and visualization strengthens my ability to solve real-world business problems.

I am always eager to learn new data analysis techniques and explore innovative tools. Whether working independently or in a team, I thrive on uncovering insights and leveraging data to solve complex challenges.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

## Analyzing Starbucks Case Study
In this project, I analyzed Starbucks customer data to understand how different customer segments respond to promotional offers and to develop data-driven strategies for improving offer effectiveness.

Project Overview
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Identify customer segments based on transactional behavior and offer response patterns to optimize marketing strategies.
ðŸ”¹ Data: Three datasets covering customer demographics, offer details, and offer-event interactions (e.g., offer viewed, completed transactions).
ðŸ”¹ Approach:
Data Cleaning & Transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through Univariate & Bivariate analysis to uncover insights.
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering (Elbow & Silhouette methods determined K=5).
Validation of clusters using Logistic Regression & K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (achieved 99.5% and 97.39% accuracy, respectively).
Business Strategy development based on cluster statistics such as frequency, offer completion rate, offer sensitivity, and average purchase value.
