# Chemuru Lasya-Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Lasya! I have an analytical background in Mechanics and am currently completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification on Coursera while awaiting onboarding at TCS. My passion lies in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, where I enjoy transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive business decisions.I worked as an Intern at Synchrony Financial about 6 months and gained hands-on experience in BigData tools that includes PySpark, Hadoop, Apache Hive, BitBucket and Tableau.

I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data analytics, and visualization tools.Iâ€™ve sharpened my skills through case study competitions, earning runner-up in Data Doyen (IMT Ghaziabad). My portfolio includes projects integrating analytics and ML, for keeping pace with evolving technologies. My experience in statistical analysis, forcasting trends, and visualization strengthens my ability to solve real-world business problems.  
I am always eager to learn new data analysis techniques and explore innovative tools. Whether working independently or in a team, I thrive on uncovering insights and leveraging data to solve complex challenges.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

## Starbucks Case Study
This project analyzes Starbucks customer data to identify key customer segments based on their transactional behavior and response to promotional offers. By leveraging unsupervised and supervised machine learning models, the goal is to develop targeted marketing strategies that enhance offer effectiveness.  
Approach & Techniques  
âœ” Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Ensured structured, high-quality data.  
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Uncovered trends and insights.  
âœ” Customer Segmentation â€“ Segmented customers into 5 groups using K-means clustering, Elbow & Silhouette methods.  
âœ” Model Validation â€“ Verified clusters using Logistic Regression & KNN (99.5% & 97.39% accuracy).  
âœ” Business Insights & Strategy â€“ Derived personalized marketing recommendations based on:Offer sensitivity, Purchase frequency, Completion rates, Average spending behavior

## Automated Web Data ETL Pipeline and NLP
This project builds a Web Data ETL Pipeline using Python, extracting news articles from the web using BeautifulSoup4. The extracted text is processed and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including:Topic Modeling to identify key themes, Text Summarization for concise article overviews, Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract important entities, and Sentiment Analysis to measure polarity and subjectivity.  
To demonstrate its real-world application, the project compares sentiment scores of BBC and CNN on the same topic. The results highlight variations in tone, subjectivity, and bias between the two news sources, showcasing how automated NLP pipelines can be leveraged for media analysis.

## Employee Logs Time Series Data Analysis  
The primary objective is to create realistic time-based data with python libraries suitable for performing time-series SQL queries, which will be used to build a Tableau dashboard for monitoring employee working hours.The generated dataset will mimic real-world login patterns, capturing variations in working hours, overtime, breaks, and irregularities. This data will allow organizations to analyze trends, identify potential inefficiencies, and ensure employees adhere to their expected schedules. By leveraging SQL for querying and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard will provide insightful metrics such as average working hours, late logins, early logouts, and overtime trends, enhancing workforce analytics and decision-making.

## Ad Hoc Analysis on Credit card Attrition Rate  
This project analyzes credit card customer attrition to uncover factors influencing churn and identify customers at risk. Using SQL for data extraction & transformation and Power BI for visualization, I generated key business insights to help financial institutions improve retention strategies.  
âœ” Analyzed customer attrition trends by age, income, product holdings, and inactivity.  
âœ” Segmented customers to identify patterns between churned vs. existing users.  
âœ” Predicted at-risk customers using transaction volume, inactivity, and engagement levels.  
âœ” Used SQL for ad hoc business insights and Power BI for dashboards.

## Bank Loan Summary and Overview Dashboards
This project features a Dynamic Interactive Excel Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize Bank Loan Data effectively. The dashboard provides key insights into loan applications, funding, repayment performance, and other critical financial metrics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.  
I have built two key dashboards:  
1.Summary Dashboard â€“ Provides an overview of key loan metrics, including Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, etc. It also categorizes loans into Good Loans (fully paid & curent) and Bad Loans (charged off), displaying their respective percentages, funded amounts, and applications.  
2.Overview Dashboard â€“ Offers a detailed breakdown of loan applications by month, state, loan term, employment length, loan purpose, and homeownership status. This helps identify trends and patterns in loan distributions.  
âœ” Dynamic KPIs Tracking for Month to date and month on month growths.  
âœ” Comparative Analysis on Fully-paid, current and charged-off application using bar charts.  
âœ” Geographical & Trend Analysis on loan applications by state, purpose, home-ownership etc.  
âœ” Interactive Slicers for koan grade and loan purpose filters  
âœ” Pivot Table Integration ensuring effective data processing and interactivity.
