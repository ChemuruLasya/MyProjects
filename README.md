# Chemuru Lasya-Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Lasya! I have an analytical background in Mechanics and am currently completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification on Coursera while awaiting onboarding at TCS. My passion lies in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, where I enjoy transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive business decisions.I worked as an Intern at Synchrony Financial about 6 months and gained hands-on experience in BigData tools that includes PySpark, Hadoop, Apache Hive, BitBucket and Tableau.

I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data analytics, and visualization tools.Iâ€™ve sharpened my skills through case study competitions, earning runner-up in Data Doyen (IMT Ghaziabad). My portfolio includes projects integrating analytics and ML, for keeping pace with evolving technologies. My experience in trend analysis, and visualization strengthens my ability to solve real-world business problems.  
I am always eager to learn new data analysis techniques and explore innovative tools. Whether working independently or in a team, I thrive on uncovering insights and leveraging data to solve complex challenges.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

## Starbucks Case Study
This project analyzes Starbucks customer data to identify key customer segments based on their transactional behavior and response to promotional offers. By leveraging unsupervised and supervised machine learning models, the goal is to develop targeted marketing strategies that enhance offer effectiveness.  
Approach & Techniques  
âœ” Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Ensured structured, high-quality data.  
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Uncovered trends and insights.  
âœ” Customer Segmentation â€“ Segmented customers into 5 groups using K-means clustering, Elbow & Silhouette methods.  
âœ” Model Validation â€“ Verified clusters using Logistic Regression & KNN (99.5% & 97.39% accuracy).  
âœ” Business Insights & Strategy â€“ Derived personalized marketing recommendations based on:Offer sensitivity, Purchase frequency, Completion rates, Average spending behavior

## Automated Web Data ETL Pipeline and NLP
This project builds a Web Data ETL Pipeline using Python, extracting news articles from the web using BeautifulSoup4. The extracted text is processed and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including:Topic Modeling to identify key themes, Text Summarization for concise article overviews, Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract important entities, and Sentiment Analysis to measure polarity and subjectivity.  
To demonstrate its real-world application, the project compares sentiment scores of BBC and CNN on the same topic. The results highlight variations in tone, subjectivity, and bias between the two news sources, showcasing how automated NLP pipelines can be leveraged for media analysis.

â€¢ Worked on optimizing the Credit Loss model written in Python by removing unwanted models, avoiding hard-coded parameters, and enhancing code flexibility and maintainability. 
â€¢ Gained hands-on training in customizing Tableau dashboards for quick data insights and ETL processes for data extraction. Worked with SQL by creating duplicate datasets for thorough testing. 
â€¢ Converted modified notebooks into Python scripts, integrated them with Bitbucket, and developed a shell script to automate Spark configurations to run Python scripts and handle input errors. 
 
Accomplishments: Reduced model execution time by 25%, transitioning the Credit Loss model to operational mode, which improved productivity and streamlined workflows.
